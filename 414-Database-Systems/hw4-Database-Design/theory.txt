a. (10 points) R(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies D → B, CE → A.

b. (10 points) S(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies A → E, BC → A, DE → B.

For each of the above schemas, decompose it into BCNF. Show all of your work and explain, 
at each step, which dependency violations you are correcting. Make sure you describe each 
step in your decomposition steps. (10 points each)


-- Decomposition for a. R(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies D → B, CE → A.

Using the BCNF algorithm, we start with R(A,B,C,D,E). Looking at the given functional dependencies
let's start with D from D -> B. We see that the closure of D is not itself nor is it all the 
elements in R, so we have to decompose. I will split on D.

Now we have R1(D, B) and R2(D, A, C, E). R1 is in BCNF because each element in R1 has a closure of
itself or all the elements in R1. R2 is not in BCNF because we found set CE whose closure is not 
itself nor is it all of R2. Using the given FD CE -> A, we will split onCE.

Now we have R1(D, B) R3(C, E, A) and R4(D, C, E). All of these relations are in BCNF so we finished.

-- Decomposition for b. S(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies A → E, BC → A, DE → B. 

Using the BCNF algorithm, we start with S(A,B,C,D,E). Looking at the given functional dependencies
let's start with A from A -> E. We see that the closure of A is not itself nor is it all the 
elements in S, so we have to decompose. I will split on A.

Now we have S1(A, E) and S2(A, B, C, D). S1 is in BCNF because every element in S1 has a closure 
of itself or every element in S1. S2 is not in BCNF Look at the next FD BC -> A. BC has a closure
that is not itself nor is it every element in S2. So we split on BC.

Now we have S1(A, E), S3(B, C, A) and S4(B, C, D). These are in BCNF so we are done.

---------------

A set of attributes X is called closed (with respect to a given set of functional dependencies) if 
X⁺ = X. Consider a relation with schema R(A,B,C,D) and an unknown set of functional dependencies. 
For each closed attribute set below, give a set of functional dependencies that is consistent 
with it.

c. (5 points) All subsets of {A,B,C,D} are closed.
	∅ = {}  = the empty set = No functional dependencies
	
d. (5 points) The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {} and {A,B,C,D}.
	A -> B, B -> C, C -> D, D -> A. {A -> B, B -> C, C -> D, D -> A}

e. (5 points) The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {}, {B,C}, and {A,B,C,D}.
	B -> C, C -> B, A -> D, D -> B, A. {B -> C, C -> B, A -> D, D -> B, A}

* I checked all 16 subsets on a scratch piece of paper so hopefully I checked correctly.
